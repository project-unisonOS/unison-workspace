# Security

This repository is the meta workspace for UnisonOS, aggregating core services, devstack, and documentation as Git submodules plus helper scripts.

The workspace is intended for local development on trusted hardware. For overall security guidance and production deployment considerations, including how individual services should be exposed and secured, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you discover a security issue in the workspace scripts or configuration, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
