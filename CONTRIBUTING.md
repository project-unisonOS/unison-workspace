# Contributing

Follow the org-wide guidelines in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- Keep secrets out of the repo; never commit `.env` or tokens.
- Run lint/tests before PRs; add abuse-case tests when touching auth/policy flows.
- Seek at least one review; security-sensitive changes should involve `@project-unisonOS/security-leads`.
